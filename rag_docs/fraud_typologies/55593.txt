Abstract 
The rapid expansion of digital financial services in India, including Unified Payments Interface (UPI), 
mobile wallets, and internet banking, has significantly enhanced financial inclusion and convenience. 
However, this digital transformation has simultane ously created new vulnerabilities for fraudsters to 
exploit. This study synthesizes insights from global and Indian literature, case reports, and regulatory 
documents to examine the typologies of digital banking fraud, patterns of victim behaviour, institu tional 
responses, and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI)  driven detection mechanisms. Drawing upon 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Ombudsman reports, the National Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF), 
international case studies from Zimbabwe, the European Union, and Saudi Arabia, as well as 
criminological perspectives, the  paper develops a holistic framework for understanding and combating 
digital fraud in India. Findings indicate that phishing, vishing, SIM swap, QR/UPI scams, ATM skimming, 
and Ponzi schemes remain dominant, with social engineering as a critical enabler. Victim susceptibility 
stems from trust in authority, urgency appeals, and low digital literacy, particularly among rural and 
elderly populations. Despite RBI initiatives such as the BE(A)WA RE campaign and regulatory 
enhancements, significant challenges remain, including underreporting, fragmented detection systems, 
and cross-border fraud networks using the dark web and cryptocurrencies. The paper recommends multi-
stakeholder strategies: AI-enabled fraud monitoring platforms, unified reporting mechanisms, consumer 
digital literacy programs, and international collaboration for cybercrime intelligence. The study concludes 
that India’s success in balancing financial inclusion with cyber resilienc e will depend on integrating 
technology, regulation, and behavioural insights.

1. Introduction 
Digital banking in India has witnessed a remarkable transformation over the past decade, propelled by the 
government’s Digital India initiative, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) regulatory push, and consumer 
adoption of mobile-based payment platforms such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). According to 
the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI transactions crossed 14 billion monthly 
transactions in 2025, highlighting its centrality in India’s payment ecosystem. This digital revolution ha s 
advanced financial inclusion, expanded access to credit, and improved efficiency in banking services.

Yet, the convenience of digital banking has come at a cost: a surge in electronic frauds. RBI’s Ombudsman 
office reported exponential increases in fraud complaints relating to phishing links, QR code scams, SIM 
swaps, ATM skimming, and Ponzi schemes, dispr oportionately affecting first-time digital users (Office 
of RBI Ombudsman, 2021). The National Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF, 2016) reported over 19,500 e -
fraud cases in India in 2016 alone, representing an 82% increase from the previous year (Thakur, 2019) . 
With the rise of UPI and mobile banking, fraudulent techniques have become more sophisticated, 
leveraging social engineering, malware, and dark web data markets. 
Globally, cyber -enabled fraud has been recognized as a systemic risk for banking institutions. For 
example, in Zimbabwe, inadequate cybercrime laws and lack of consumer awareness contributed to 
widespread fraud vulnerabilities (Dzomira, 2014). In the Europ ean Union and UK, large -scale payment 
frauds exploited vulnerabilities in SWIFT networks and airline platforms (European Cybersecurity 
Agency, 2018). Victimology research in the UK revealed that susceptibility arises from urgency pressures, 
trust in authority figures, and embarrassment in reporting (Button et al., 2014). These findings resonate 
with the Indian context, where digital literacy gaps make rural and elderly populations especially 
vulnerable. 
This study, therefore, seeks to provide a comprehensive examination of digital banking fraud in India by 
situating it within a global comparative lens. Specifically, it aims to: 
1. Identify and classify the typologies of fraud affecting Indian digital banking. 
2. Analyse victim behaviours and vulnerabilities in the Indian context. 
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of institutional responses and governance mechanisms, including RBI 
initiatives and fraud detection systems. 
4. Explore the potential of AI-enabled solutions for fraud detection and prevention. 
5. Provide policy recommendations for strengthening India’s fraud resilience while sustaining  financial 
inclusion. 
Social engineering in the Indian context is a complex issue rooted in a blend of psychological and socio -
cultural factors. Fraudsters exploit inherent cognitive biases like urgency and authority bias, causing 
victims to bypass critical thinking and act on impulse. This vulnerability is heightened by a significant 
digital literacy gap, especially among first-time internet users and the elderly who may lack awareness of 
basic cybersecurity hygiene. Furthermore, socio-cultural norms, such as a deep-seated respect for authority 
and a reluctance to report due to shame, create a fertile ground for scams to thrive. These factors, combined 
with sophisticated tactics like grooming victims over time, allow fraudsters to normalize small, repeated 
payments, making it difficult for both individuals and banking systems to detect the cumulative loss until 
it becomes substantial. The following flowchart and figure 1 depicts the cycle of the frauds that occur in 
a life cycle. 
 
Fraud Lifecycle and Response 
1. Attack 
o Victim Response: Social Engineering (phishing, romance scams, fake jobs), Malware, Data Breaches. 
Fraudster initiates contact/exploit. 
2. Victim Response 
o Bank Detection: Falls prey to cognitive biases (urgency, authority, greed). Unknowingly provides info 
or authorizes transactions. Delayed realization of fraud.

3. Bank Detection 
o Reporting: Transaction monitoring systems, AI/ML anomaly detection. Two -factor authentication, 
fraud alerts. Often reactive; can miss incremental losses. 
4. Reporting 
Enforcement: Victim reports to bank/authorities. Reluctance due to shame/lack of awareness. Low 
reporting rates reduce comprehensive data. 
5. Enforcement 
o Attack (implied feedback loop for deterrence)  : Investigation, prosecution, recovery of funds. 
Deterrence through legal action. Weak prosecution can lead to repeat offenses. 
 
 
Fig 1: Fraud Lifecycle and Response 
 
This structure covers the flow from the initial attack to the final enforcement, with key aspects of each 
stage. By integrating insights from Indian and global studies, the paper contributes to the scholarly 
understanding of e-banking fraud as a socio-technical phenomenon. It argues that addressing digital fraud 
requires not only technological upgrades but also behav ioural interventions, regulatory coherence, and 
international cooperation. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The emergence of core banking systems, UPI, and mobile payment platforms has revolutionized financial 
services in India. Internet banking allows customers to perform transactions without visiting a branch, 
enabled by centralized databases and online channe ls. With this transition, fraud has migrated from 
physical cheque manipulation and insider collusion to cyber -enabled mechanisms such as phishing, 
spyware, skimming, and hacking. 
The RBI Ombudsman’s BE(A)WARE report (2021) emphasizes that fraudsters exploit social engineering, 
including phishing links, vishing calls, QR code scams, and SIM swaps, often targeting digitally 
inexperienced consumers. Fraud via online selling platforms and UPI “request money” scams have 
become increasingly prevalent, with unsuspecting victims authorizing debit transactions believing they 
are receiving money. Similarly, fake loan websites, Ponzi schemes, and forged documents have emerged 
as prominent threats in the NBFC sector.

Indian studies highlight a dual gap: (1) Consumer awareness remains low, leading to behavioural 
vulnerabilities; (2) Bank governance structures often rely heavily on technological firewalls, without 
adequately addressing fraud through customer education an d reporting clarity (Thakur, 2019).  
Globally, the problem of e-banking fraud is not unique to India. Zimbabwe’s banking sector, for example, 
has faced challenges of inadequate cybercrime legislation, weak detection tools, and poor awareness 
programs (Dzomira, 2014). The EU and UK experiences with SWIFT and large-scale breaches highlight 
the need for strong institutional coordination and cross -border cooperation. Victimology research from 
the UK and Australia emphasizes the role of grooming, authority, and urgency in facilitating fraud (Button 
et al., 2014). 
 
3. Typologies of Fraud in Indian Digital Banking 
The figure 2 and figure 3 shows typologies of Fraud in Indian Digital Banking. Table 1 shows the detailed 
typologies of digital banking fraud in India. 
 
 
Fig 2: Fraud in Indian Digital Banking 
 
3.1 Phishing and Smishing 
Phishing remains one of the most common entry points for fraudsters. Fraudsters design websites 
resembling legitimate banking portals or e-commerce platforms, luring customers via links sent over SMS 
(smishing), email, or instant messaging. Once users input login credentials, the data is captured and used 
for unauthorized transactions (RBI Ombudsman, 2021). 
In India, phishing often exploits themes such as income tax refunds, KYC updates, and fake RBI or bank 
'security alerts.' The 2019 CERT -In advisory reported that phishing cases increased markedly, with UPI 
and net banking users as prime targets. 
3.2 Vishing (Voice Phishing) 
Vishing involves fraudsters impersonating bank officials, RBI representatives, or government agents 
through phone calls, seeking to extract OTPs, PINs, or card details. Fraudsters often build trust by citing 
personal data already obtained from leaked datab ases. Tactics commonly include threats of account 
suspension or offers of loan approvals, creating urgency to bypass victims' skepticism.

IJFMR250555593 Volume 7, Issue 5, September-October 2025 5 
 
3.3 QR Code and UPI 'Request Money' Scams 
With India’s rapid shift to UPI, fraudsters have devised scams targeting QR codes and UPI's 'collect' 
feature. Customers scanning fraudulent codes to 'receive payments' end up initiating debit transactions. 
Fraudsters posing as buyers on platforms like OLX  send 'payment requests,' tricking sellers into 
authorizing debits instead of credits. These scams are uniquely Indian in scale and prevalence, reflecting 
both UPI’s success and its vulnerabilities. 
3.4 SIM Swap and SIM Cloning 
SIM swap fraud occurs when fraudsters obtain a duplicate SIM card of the victim’s mobile number, 
enabling interception of OTPs and alerts. Cloning exploits telecom service loopholes or social engineering 
against customer service staff. In India, SIM swap i ncidents have been tied to organized fraud rings 
colluding with telecom agents. 
3.5 ATM Skimming and Card Cloning 
Though mobile fraud dominates headlines, ATM skimming persists, particularly in semi -urban areas. 
Fraudsters install skimming devices and hidden cameras on ATMs to capture card data and PINs. Despite 
RBI’s mandate for EMV chip cards, vulnerabilities remain in legacy systems. 
3.6 Remote Access and Malware Attacks 
Fraudsters trick victims into downloading remote access apps (e.g., TeamViewer, AnyDesk) under the 
guise of 'customer support.' Once installed, fraudsters gain full access to the victim’s device, capturing 
banking credentials. Malware-based frauds also int ercept SMS OTPs or manipulate banking apps in the 
background. 
3.7 Lottery, Job, and Investment Scams 
Indian consumers are often targeted with fraudulent job offers or lottery winnings requiring upfront 
'processing fees.' Ponzi schemes and MLM models continue to thrive in rural areas, despite RBI and SEBI 
crackdowns. 
3.8 Social Media and Impersonation Scams 
Fraudsters impersonate trusted contacts on WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram to solicit urgent money 
transfers. Fake celebrity or government profiles are also used to spread fraudulent links or investment 
opportunities. 
3.9 Juice Jacking and Device-Based Fraud 
'Juice jacking' involves malware installed in public USB charging stations that capture banking credentials 
when users connect their phones. Several metropolitan police departments have issued advisories warning 
commuters. 
3.10 Cross-Border and Dark Web Enabled Frauds 
Fraud networks increasingly leverage the dark web to purchase stolen credentials, card data, or malware 
kits. Payments are laundered using cryptocurrencies, complicating enforcement. Indian agencies like 
CERT-In and FIU-IND have highlighted cases where domestic frauds were coordinated from international 
call centers.

4. Victim Behaviour and Social Engineering in the Indian Context 
Fig 4 shows the victim behavior and social engineering  (2024) and the detail on the basis of Indian context 
is shown here. 
 
 
Fig 4: Victim Behavior and Social Engineering 
 
4.1 Cognitive Biases and Decision-Making Traps 
Victims often fall prey due to inherent cognitive biases: authority bias, urgency effect, greed and 
opportunity bias, and trust in technology. These biases cause victims to act quickly without verifying 
legitimacy. 
4.2 Socio-Cultural Factors 
The Indian socio-cultural environment intensifies susceptibility: respect for authority, reluctance to report 
fraud due to shame, and community-based spread of schemes in rural areas. 
4.3 Digital Literacy Divide 
India’s digital inclusion drive has brought millions of first-time users into the banking system, but the gap 
between access and literacy is stark. Rural and elderly populations often lack awareness of basic 
cybersecurity hygiene. 
4.4 Grooming and Relationship-Based Fraud 
Beyond one-off scams, fraudsters often invest time in grooming victims via romance scams or fake job 
relationships, lowering defenses and increasing the likelihood of compliance. 
4.5 Incremental Losses and Normalization 
Small, repeated payments reduce suspicion and normalize illicit transfers until cumulative losses become 
substantial, evading simple threshold-based detection systems. 
4.6 Victim Profiles in India 
Victim profiles include first-time digital adopters, elderly account holders, aspirational youth, and urban 
users with overconfidence in their digital skills.

4.7 Criminological Perspectives 
Routine Activity Theory and the Fraud Triangle provide frameworks (2024) for understanding 
victimization; low reporting and weak prosecution reduce deterrence. 
 
5. Fraud Risk Governance and Detection Mechanisms 
Table 2 shows the RBI & CERT-In Initiatives from 2011-2025. Table 3 shows the models from artificial 
intelligence in digital fraud. 
5.1 Risk Governance in the Indian Banking Sector 
Fraud governance refers to the structured frameworks and institutional controls banks employ to prevent, 
detect, and respond to fraud. RBI mandates include two -factor authentication, chip -and-PIN cards, 
transaction monitoring systems, and compensation fram eworks. However, governance remains uneven 
across institutions. 
5.2 RBI and National-Level Initiatives 
BE(A)WARE Campaign (2021), NeFF's centralized fraud repository, CERT -In's six -hour incident 
reporting rule, and Digital Payment Security Controls (2023) are important national -level initiatives 
shifting focus toward proactive detection. 
5.3 Traditional Detection Mechanisms 
Rule-based systems (thresholds, blacklists) detect known fraud patterns but struggle against adaptive, low-
value, or novel frauds. 
5.4 AI and Machine Learning in Fraud Detection 
Supervised models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression), unsupervised models (clustering, anomaly 
detection), and deep learning  (2022) for behavioural biometrics are increasingly used. Indian fintechs 
employ device fingerprinting and behavioural analytics, though data quality and privacy constraints 
persist. 
5.5 Multi-Layered Controls 
Best practice combines prevention (education, authentication), detection (AI/ML), response (freezing 
accounts, law enforcement), and recovery (refunds). A central fraud registry enhances systemic resilience. 
5.6 Challenges in Risk Governance 
Fragmented oversight, resource gaps in smaller banks, data privacy concerns, and underreporting of 
incidents undermine governance effectiveness. 
 
6. Indian Regulatory and Policy Landscape 
The RBI is the apex regulator. Key measures: mandatory 2FA, zero liability policy, BE(A)WARE 
consumer campaigns, CERT-In incident reporting, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (202 2), and 
digital lending guidelines. 
Inter-agency coordination initiatives (RBI -CERT-In Task Force 2024) and FIU -IND tracking of crypto 
laundering are recent steps. Enforcement and prosecution remain challenging. 
 
Table 2: RBI & CERT-In Initiatives (2011–2025) 
Year Initiative Focus Impact 
2011 Mandatory 2FA Authentication Reduced card-not-present fraud 
2017 Zero Liability Policy Consumer protection Encouraged reporting
