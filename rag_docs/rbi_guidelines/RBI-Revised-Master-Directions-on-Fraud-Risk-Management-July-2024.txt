Introduction 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued revised Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management in July 2024, superseding 
previous guidelines and consolidating 36 existing circulars. These comprehensive directions apply to a wide range of 
regulated entities, including commercial banks, cooperative banks, and non-banking finance companies.  
Purpose and Objective 
The Reserve Bank of India's Revised Master Directions on Fraud Risk Management, issued on July 15, 2024, aim to provide 
a robust framework for the prevention, early detection, and timely reporting of frauds in regulated entities (REs). The 
revised guidelines aim to strengthen the role of boards in overseeing fraud risk management, enhance internal audit and 
control frameworks and ensure compliance with principles of natural justice.  
Compliance with the Principles of Natural Justice before declaration of account as fraud 
The Master Directions now expressly require that the REs shall ensure compliance with the principles of natural justice in 
a time-bound manner before classifying Persons / Entities as fraud ulent. It duly takes into account the Hon’ble Supreme 
Court Judgment dated March 27, 2023 (Civil Appeal No. 7300 of 2022 in the matter of State Bank of India & Ors. Vs. Rajesh 
Agarwal & Ors.). In this matter, the Supreme Court of India addressed the penal measures for fraudulent borrowers as 
stipulated under Clause 8.12 of the RBI's Master Directions on Frauds. The Court emphasized the application of penal 
provisions similar to those for wilful defaulters, ex tending the restrictions to promoters, directors  and whole -time 
directors of the borrowing company.  
Notably, fraudulent borrowers are barred from availing bank finance from various financial institutions for five years from 
the date of full repayment of the defrauded amount. The Court also highlighted the significance of the principles of natural 
justice, asserting that borrowers must be given an opportunity to be heard before their accounts are classified as 
fraudulent. Consequently, the Cou rt mandated that banks must serve a notice and provide a hearing to the borrowers 
before classifying their accounts as fraudulent, ensuring compliance with the principles of natural justice. 
Additionally,, the framework on Early Warning Signals (EWS) and Red Flagging of Accounts (RFA) has been further 
strengthened for early detection and prevention of frauds in the REs including timely reporting to Law Enforcement 
Agencies and Supervisors. Further, requirement for Data Analytics and Market Intelligence Unit for strengthening risk 
management systems have been mandated. These Directions have now been made applicable to Regional Rura l Banks, 
Rural Cooperative Banks and Housing Finance Companies as well.The intent is to promote better fraud risk management 
systems and framework in such REs. With the issuance of these Master Directions, the existing 36 Circulars on the subject 
stand withdrawn.  
Following are the major requirements of the RBI Guidelines on fraud risk management 
Criteria for Classification of Accounts as Fraud 
▪ Early Warning Signals (EWS) and Red Flagging of Accounts (RFA): 
− EWS Framework: Banks must establish a framework for identifying early warning signals, integrating with Core 
Banking Solutions (CBS) for real-time monitoring (Clause 8.3). 
− Red-Flagged Account (RFA) : An account with one or more EWS indicators that suggest fraudulent activity 
requires deeper investigation and preventive measures (Clause 8.3.1).

− Reporting: Accounts meeting the CRILC   (Central Repository of Information on Large Credits . It is a Database 
maintained by Reserve Bank of India by collection of Loan and Investment data of borrowers from all Financial 
Institutions) threshold and identified as RFA must be reported to the RBI within seven days (Clause 8.3.3). 
▪ Independent Confirmation: 
− Banks must ensure third-party service providers involved in the fraud are held accountable, with their details 
reported to the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) (Clause 8.12.4). 
▪ Staff Accountability: 
− Banks must examine staff accountability in fraud cases promptly. For public sector banks (PSBs) and AIFIs, this 
includes referring cases to the Advisory Board for Banking and Financial Frauds (ABBFF) (Clause 8.10.1). 
▪ Penal Measures: 
− Persons/Entities classified as fraud by banks are debarred from accessing credit facilities for five years post-
repayment or settlement (Clause 8.12.1). 
Reporting Mechanism 
▪ Reporting to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs): 
− Private Sector/Foreign Banks: Report frauds below INR 1 crore to State/UT Police; INR1 crore and above to 
SFIO and Police (Clause 8.11.1). 
− Public Sector Banks/RRBs: Report frauds below INR 6 crore to State/UT Police; INR 6 crore and above to CBI 
(Clause 8.11.1). 
▪ Reporting to RBI: 
− Fraud Monitoring Returns (FMRs): Banks must report individual fraud cases immediately but no later than 14 
days from classification (Clause 8.4.2). 
− Central Fraud Registry (CFR): Banks must utilize the CFR for effective fraud risk management (Clause 3.1). 
▪ Closure of Fraud Cases: 
− Fraud cases can be closed upon completion of LEA actions and staff accountability examination (Clause 5.1). 
− In this context, it is important to note the requirements of RBI Guidelines on settlement of fraud cases in the light 
of RBI Circular dated June 08, 2023. 
Gist of RBI Circular Dated June 8, 2023: Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write -
offs   
Compromise settlements are viewed as a viable resolution mechanism, ensuring early recoveries while maintaining 
ongoing legal actions against fraudulent or wilful defaulters. 
Compromise Settlement   in Wilful Default and Fraud Cases:  The RBI circular clarified that the provision allowing 
banks to enter into compromise settlements with borrowers classified as fraud or wilful defaulters was previously 
communicated in various guidelines, including the letter dated May 10, 2007, and the Ma ster Circulars on Wilful 
Defaulters (July 1, 2015) and Frauds (July 1, 2016). The circular emphasizes that the penal measures applicable to 
wilful defaulters and fraudulent borrowers remain unchanged. These include restrictions on obtaining new credit 
and debarment from institutional finance for a specified period. 
The circular also clarified that the introduction of a minimum 12-month cooling period applies to general compromise 
settlements, not affecting the penal measures for wilful defaulters or fraudulent borrowers. These measures 
continue to restrict borrowing despite the cooling period. It further clarified that compromise settlements must be 
approved by the bank's Board and adhere to board -approved policies. Settlements involving fraud or wilful default 
must continue criminal proceedings and be subject to judicial consent if recovery proceedings are ongoing.
