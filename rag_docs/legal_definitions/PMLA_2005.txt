official of the Reporting Entity or vice -versa. The original Officially Valid 
Document (OVD) shall be in possession of the client.

photograph of the client is captured and no printed or video -graphed 
photograph of the client is captured. The background behind the client while

on the declaration. The live photograph of the authorized official shall also 
be captured in this authorized officer's declaration. 
K. Subsequent to all these activities, the Application shall give information 
about the completion of the process and submission of activation request to 
activation officer of the Reporting Entity, and also generate the 
transactionid/reference-id number of the process. The authorized officer shall 
intimate the details regarding transaction-id/reference-id number to client for
